“All that matters is having single-minded purpose ,
in the here and now. Life is an ongoing succession 
of ‘one will’ at a time, each and every moment.
A man who realizes this truth need not hurry to do, 
or seek, anything else anymore. Just live in the present
with single-minded purpose. 
 
People forget this important truth, and keep seeking other 
things to accomplish. Having the resolve to stay the course 
comes only with years of dedicated training. 
 
If you are enlightened to this mind-set just once, 
it will always be with you, even if you are not conscious
of it everyday. 
 
Your life will become simple and clear if 
you are unwavering in purpose, knowing that ‘now’ is the time to act. 
Loyalty is a virtue born of this state of mind.”
    
    ― Yamamoto Tsunetomo
