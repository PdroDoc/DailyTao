      "Capitulo 02": "Verse 2\n\n(...)\n\nTherefore the Master\nacts without doing anything\nand teaches without saying anything.\n\nThings arise and she lets them come;\nthings disappear and she lets them go.\n\nShe has but doesn’t possess,\nacts but doesn’t expect.\nWhen her work is done, she forgets it.\nThat is why it lasts forever.",
      "Capitulo 03": "    Verse 3\n\nIf you overesteem great men,\npeople become powerless.\nIf you overvalue possessions,\npeople begin to steal.\nThe Master leads\nby emptying people’s minds and\nfilling their cores, by weakening their ambition\nand toughening their resolve.\nHe helps people lose everything\nthey know, everything they desire,\nand creates confusion\nin those who think that they know.\nPractice not-doing,\nand everything will fall into place",
      "Capitulo 04": "Verse 04\n\nThe Tao is like a well:\nused but never used up.\nIt is like the eternal void:\nfilled with infinite possibilities.\n\nIt is hidden but always present.\nI don’t know who gave birth to it.\nIt is older than God.",
      "Capitulo 05": "Verse 5\n\nThe Tao doesn’t take sides;\nit gives birth to both good and evil.\nThe Master doesn’t take sides;\nshe welcomes both saints and sinners.\n\nThe Tao is like a bellows:\nit is empty yet infinitely capable.\nThe more you use it, the more it produces;\nthe more you talk of it, the less you understand.\nHold on to the center.",
      "Capitulo 06": "verse 6\n\nThe Tao is called the Great Mother:\nempty yet inexhaustible,\nit gives birth to infinite worlds.\nIt is always present within you.\nYou can use it any way you want.",
      "Capitulo 07": "Verse 7\n\n\nThe Tao is infinite, eternal.\nWhy is it eternal?\nIt was never born;\nthus it can never die.\nWhy is it infinite?\nIt has no desires for itself;\nthus it is present for all beings.\n\nThe Master stays behind;\nthat is why she is ahead.\nShe is detached from all things;\nthat is why she is one with them.\nBecause she has let go of herself,\nshe is perfectly fulfilled.\n",
      "Capitulo 08": "Verse 8\n\n\nThe supreme good is like water,\nwhich nourishes all things without trying to.\nIt is content with the low places that people disdain.\nThus it is like the Tao.\nIn dwelling, live close to the ground.\nIn thinking, keep to the simple.\nIn conflict, be fair and generous.\nIn governing, don’t try to control.\nIn work, do what you enjoy.\nIn family life, be completely present.\nWhen you are content to be simply yourself\nand don’t compare or compete,\neverybody will respect you.",
      "Capitulo 09": "Verse 09 \n\nFill your bowl to the brim\nand it will spill.\nKeep sharpening your knife\nand it will blunt.\nChase after money and security\nand your heart will never unclench.\nCare about people’s approval\nand you will be their prisoner.\nDo your work, then step back.\nThe only path to serenity.",
      "Capitulo 10": "Verse 10\n\nCan you coax your mind from its wandering\nand keep to the original oneness?\n\nCan you let your body become\nsupple as a newborn child’s?\n\nCan you cleanse your inner vision\nuntil you see nothing but the light?\n\nCan you love people and lead them\nwithout imposing your will?\n\nCan you deal with the most vital matters\nby letting events take their course?\n\nCan you step back from your own mind\nand thus understand all things?\n\nGiving birth and nourishing,\nhaving without possessing,\nacting with no expectations,\nleading and not trying to control:\nthis is the supreme virtue.",
      "Capitulo 12": "Verse 12\n\nColors blind the eye.\nSounds deafen the ear.\nFlavors numb the taste.\nThoughts weaken the mind.\nDesires wither the heart.\n\nThe Master observes the world\nbut trusts his inner vision.\n\nHe allows things to come and go.\nHis heart is open as the sky.",
      "Capitulo 13": "    \nVerse 13\n\n\nSuccess is as dangerous as failure.\nHope is as hollow as fear.\nWhat does it mean that success is as dangerous as failure?\nWhether you go up the ladder or down it,\nyour position is shaky.\nWhen you stand with your two feet on the ground,\nyou will always keep your balance.\nWhat does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?\nHope and fear are both phantoms\nthat arise from thinking of the self.\nWhen we don’t see the self as self,\nwhat do we have to fear?\nSee the world as your self.\nHave faith in the way things are.\nLove the world as your self;\nthen you can care for all things.",
      "Capitulo 15": "15th Verse\n\n\nThe ancient masters were profound and subtle.\nTheir wisdom was unfathomable.\nThere is no way to describe it.\n\nOne can only describe them vaguely by their appearance.\nWatchful, like men crossing a winter stream.\nAlert, like men aware of danger.\nSimple, as uncarved wood.\nHollow like caves.\nYielding, like ice about to melt.\nAmorphous, like muddy water.\n\nBut the muddiest water clears\nas it is stilled.\nAnd out of that stillness\nlife arises.\n\nHe who keeps the Tao does not want to be full.\nBut precisely because he is never full,\nhe can remain like a hidden sprout\nand does not rush to early ripening.",
      "Capitulo 20": "    Verse 20\n\n\nStop thinking, and end your problems.\nWhat difference between yes and no?\nWhat difference between success and failure?\nMust you value what others value,\navoid what others avoid?\nHow ridiculous!\n\nOther people are excited,\nas though they were at a parade.\nI alone don’t care,\nI alone am expressionless,\nlike an infant before it can smile.\nOther people have what they need;\nI alone possess nothing.\n\nI alone drift about,\nlike someone without a home.\nI am like an idiot, my mind is so empty.\nOther people are bright;\nI alone am dark.\n\nOther people are sharp;\nI alone am dull.\nOther people have a purpose;\nI alone don’t know.\nI drift like a wave on the ocean,\nI blow as aimless as the wind.\nI am different from ordinary people.\nI drink from the Great Mother’s breasts.",
      "Capitulo 21": "    Verse 21\n\nThe Master keeps her mind\nalways at one with the Tao;\nthat is what gives her her radiance.\n\nThe Tao is ungraspable.\nHow can her mind be at one with it?\nBecause she doesn’t cling to ideas.\nThe Tao is dark and unfathomable.\nHow can it make her radiant?\nBecause she lets it.\n\nSince before time and space were,\nthe Tao is.\nIt is beyond is and is not.\nHow do I know this is true?\nI look inside myself and see.",
      "Capitulo 22": "\n\n22 th  Verse\n\nThe flexible are preserved unbroken.\nThe bent become straight.\nThe empty are filled.\nThe exhausted become renewed.\nThe poor are enriched.\nThe rich are confounded.\n\nTherefore the sage embraces the one.\nBecause he doesn’t display himself,\npeople can see his light.\nBecause he has nothing to prove\npeople can trust his words.\nBecause he doesn’t know who he is,\npeople recognize themselves in him.\nBecause he has no goal in mind,\neverything he does succeeds.\n\nThe old saying that the flexible are preserved unbroken is surely right!\n\nIf you have truly attained wholeness,\neverything will flock to you.",
      "Capitulo 23": "Verse 23\n\nExpress yourself completely,\nthen keep quiet.\n\nBe like the forces of nature:\nwhen it blows, there is only wind;\nwhen it rains, there is only rain;\nwhen the clouds pass, the sun shines through.\n\nIf you open yourself to the Tao,\nyou are at one with the Tao\nand you can embody it completely.\nIf you open yourself to insight,\nyou are at one with insight\nand you can use it completely.\n\nIf you open yourself to loss,\nyou are at one with loss\nand you can accept it completely.\nOpen yourself to the Tao,\nthen trust your natural responses;\nand everything will fall into place.",
      "Capitulo 25": "Verse 25\n\nThere was something formless and perfect\nbefore the universe was born.\n\nIt is serene. Empty.\nSolitary. Unchanging.\nInfinite. Eternally present.\nIt is the mother of the universe.\n\nFor lack of a better name,\nI call it the Tao.\n\nIt flows through all things,\ninside and outside, and returns\nto the origin of all things.\n\nThe Tao is great.\nThe universe is great.\nEarth is great.\nMan is great.\n\nThese are the four great powers.\nMan follows the earth.\nEarth follows the universe.\nThe universe follows the Tao.\nThe Tao follows only itself.",
      "Capitulo 33": "\nVerse 33\n\nKnowing others is intelligence;\nknowing yourself is true wisdom.\nMastering others is strength;\nmastering yourself is true power.\n\nIf you realize that you have enough,\nyou are truly rich.\nIf you stay in the center\nand embrace death with your whole heart,\nyou will endure forever.",
      "Capitulo 38": "Verse 38\n\nThe Master doesn’t try to be powerful;\nthus he is truly powerful.\nThe ordinary man keeps reaching for power;\nthus he never has enough.\n\nThe Master does nothing,\nyet he leaves nothing undone.\nThe ordinary man is always doing things,\nyet many more are left to be done.\n\nThe kind man does something,\nyet something remains undone.\nThe just man does something,\nand leaves many things to be done.\nThe moral man does something,\nand when no one responds\nhe rolls up his sleeves and uses force.\n\nWhen the Tao is lost, there is goodness.\nWhen goodness is lost, there is morality.\nWhen morality is lost, there is ritual.\nRitual is the husk of true faith,\nthe beginning of chaos.\n\nTherefore the Master concerns himself\nwith the depths and not the surface,\nwith the fruit and not the flower.\nHe has no will of his own.\nHe dwells in reality,\nand lets all illusions go.",
      "Capitulo 50": "Verse 50\n\nThe Master gives himself up\nto whatever the moment brings.\nHe knows that he is going to die,\nand he has nothing left to hold on to:\nno illusions in his mind,\nno resistances in his body.\nHe doesn’t think about his actions;\nthey flow from the core of his being.\nHe holds nothing back from life;\ntherefore he is ready for death,\nas a man is ready for sleep\nafter a good day’s work.",
      "Capitulo 55": " 55th Verse \n\nHe who is in harmony with the Tao\nis like a newborn child.\nIts bones are soft, its muscles are weak,\nbut its grip is powerful.\nIt doesn’t know about the union\nof male and female,\nyet its penis can stand erect,\nso intense is its vital power.\nIt can scream its head off all day,\nyet it never becomes hoarse,\nso complete is its harmony.\nThe Master’s power is like this.\nHe lets all things come and go\neffortlessly, without desire.\nHe never expects results;\nthus he is never disappointed.\nHe is never disappointed;\nthus his spirit never grows old.\n",
      "Capitulo 68": "Verse 68\n\nThe best athlete\nwants his opponent at his best.\nThe best general\nenters the mind of his enemy.\nThe best businessman\nserves the communal good.\nThe best leader\nfollows the will of the people.\nAll of them embody\nthe virtue of non-competition.\nNot that they don’t love to compete,\nbut they do it in the spirit of play.\nIn this they are like children\nand in harmony with the Tao.",
      "Capitulo 73": "Verse 73\n\nThe Tao is always at ease.\nIt overcomes without competing,\nanswers without speaking a word,\narrives without being summoned,\naccomplishes without a plan.\nIts net covers the whole universe.\nAnd though its meshes are wide,\nit doesn’t let a thing slip through.",
      "Capitulo 74": "    Verse 74 \n\nIf you realize that all things change,\nthere is nothing you will try to hold on to.\nIf you aren’t afraid of dying,\nthere is nothing you can’t achieve.\nTrying to control the future\nis like trying to take the master carpenter’s place.\nWhen you handle the master carpenter’s tools,\nchances are that you’ll cut yourself.",
      "Capitulo 76": "    Verse 76\n\nMen are born soft and supple;\ndead, they are stiff and hard.\nPlants are born tender and pliant;\ndead, they are brittle and dry.\nThus whoever is stiff and inflexible\nis a disciple of death.\nWhoever is soft and yielding\nis a disciple of life.\nThe hard and stiff will be broken.\nThe soft and supple will prevail.",
      "Capitulo 78": "\n78th Verse\n\nNothing in the world is softer\nand weaker than water.\nBut for attacking the hard, the unyielding,\nnothing can surpass it.\nThere is nothing like it.\nThe weak overcomes the strong;\nthe soft surpasses the hard.\n\nIn all the world, there is no one who does not know\nthis, but no one can master the practice.\n\nTherefore the master remains\nserene in the midst of sorrow;\nevil cannot enter his heart.\n\nBecause he has given up helping,\nhe is people’ s greatest help.\nTrue words appear paradoxical.",
      "Capitulo 79": "79 Verse\n\n\nAfter a bitter quarrel, some resentment remains.\nWhat can one do about it?\nBeing content with what you have\nis always best in the end.\n\nSomeone must risk returning injury with kindness,\nor hostility will never turn to goodwill.\n\nSo the wise always give without expecting gratitude.\nOne with true virtue\nalways seeks a way to give.\nOne who lacks true virtue\nalways seeks a way to get\nTo the giver comes the fullness of life;\nto the taker, just an empty hand.\n",
      "Capitulo 81": "\nVerse 81\n\nTrue words aren’t eloquent;\neloquent words aren’t true.\n\nWise men don’t need to prove their point;\nmen who need to prove their point aren’t wise.\n\nThe Master has no possessions.\nThe more he does for others,\nthe happier he is.\nThe more he gives to others,\nthe wealthier he is.\n\nThe Tao nourishes by not forcing.\nBy not dominating, the Master leads.",
      "capitulo 63": "Verse 63\n\nIf you’re nothing doing what you do,\nyou act without acting\nand savor without savoring,\nyou render the small vast and the few many,\nuse Integrity to repay hatred,\nsee the complexity in simplicity,\nfind the vast in the minute.\n\nThe complex affairs of all beneath heaven are there in simplicity,\nand the vast affairs of all beneath heaven are there in the minute.\nThat’s why a sage never bothers with vastness\nand so becomes utterly vast.\nEasy promises breed little trust,\nand too much simplicity breeds too much complexity.\nThat’s why a sage inhabits the complexity of things\nand so avoids all complexity."
