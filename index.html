      "Capitulo 15": "15th Verse\n\n\nThe ancient masters were profound and subtle.\nTheir wisdom was unfathomable.\nThere is no way to describe it.\n\nOne can only describe them vaguely by their appearance.\nWatchful, like men crossing a winter stream.\nAlert, like men aware of danger.\nSimple, as uncarved wood.\nHollow like caves.\nYielding, like ice about to melt.\nAmorphous, like muddy water.\n\nBut the muddiest water clears\nas it is stilled.\nAnd out of that stillness\nlife arises.\n\nHe who keeps the Tao does not want to be full.\nBut precisely because he is never full,\nhe can remain like a hidden sprout\nand does not rush to early ripening.",
      "Capitulo 22": "\n\n22 th  Verse\n\nThe flexible are preserved unbroken.\nThe bent become straight.\nThe empty are filled.\nThe exhausted become renewed.\nThe poor are enriched.\nThe rich are confounded.\n\nTherefore the sage embraces the one.\nBecause he doesn’t display himself,\npeople can see his light.\nBecause he has nothing to prove\npeople can trust his words.\nBecause he doesn’t know who he is,\npeople recognize themselves in him.\nBecause he has no goal in mind,\neverything he does succeeds.\n\nThe old saying that the flexible are preserved unbroken is surely right!\n\nIf you have truly attained wholeness,\neverything will flock to you.",
      "Capitulo 33": "\nVerse 33\n\nKnowing others is intelligence;\nknowing yourself is true wisdom.\nMastering others is strength;\nmastering yourself is true power.\n\nIf you realize that you have enough,\nyou are truly rich.\nIf you stay in the center\nand embrace death with your whole heart,\nyou will endure forever.",
      "Capitulo 50": "Verse 50\n\nThe Master gives himself up\nto whatever the moment brings.\nHe knows that he is going to die,\nand he has nothing left to hold on to:\nno illusions in his mind,\nno resistances in his body.\nHe doesn’t think about his actions;\nthey flow from the core of his being.\nHe holds nothing back from life;\ntherefore he is ready for death,\nas a man is ready for sleep\nafter a good day’s work.",
      "Capitulo 55": " 55th Verse \n\nHe who is in harmony with the Tao\nis like a newborn child.\nIts bones are soft, its muscles are weak,\nbut its grip is powerful.\nIt doesn’t know about the union\nof male and female,\nyet its penis can stand erect,\nso intense is its vital power.\nIt can scream its head off all day,\nyet it never becomes hoarse,\nso complete is its harmony.\nThe Master’s power is like this.\nHe lets all things come and go\neffortlessly, without desire.\nHe never expects results;\nthus he is never disappointed.\nHe is never disappointed;\nthus his spirit never grows old.\n",
      "Capitulo 78": "\n78th Verse\n\nNothing in the world is softer\nand weaker than water.\nBut for attacking the hard, the unyielding,\nnothing can surpass it.\nThere is nothing like it.\nThe weak overcomes the strong;\nthe soft surpasses the hard.\n\nIn all the world, there is no one who does not know\nthis, but no one can master the practice.\n\nTherefore the master remains\nserene in the midst of sorrow;\nevil cannot enter his heart.\n\nBecause he has given up helping,\nhe is people’ s greatest help.\nTrue words appear paradoxical.",
      "Capitulo 23": "Verse 23\n\nExpress yourself completely,\nthen keep quiet.\n\nBe like the forces of nature:\nwhen it blows, there is only wind;\nwhen it rains, there is only rain;\nwhen the clouds pass, the sun shines through.\n\nIf you open yourself to the Tao,\nyou are at one with the Tao\nand you can embody it completely.\nIf you open yourself to insight,\nyou are at one with insight\nand you can use it completely.\n\nIf you open yourself to loss,\nyou are at one with loss\nand you can accept it completely.\nOpen yourself to the Tao,\nthen trust your natural responses;\nand everything will fall into place."
