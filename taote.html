  "Capitulo 01": "\nThe tao that can be told\nis not the eternal Tao.\nThe name that can be named\nis not the eternal Name.\n\nThe unnamable is the eternally real.\nNaming is the origin\nof all particular things.\n\nFree from desire, you realize the mystery.\nCaught in desire, you see only the manifestations.\nYet mystery and manifestations\narise from the same source.\n\nThis source is called darkness.\nDarkness within darkness.\nThe gateway to all understanding.",
  "Capitulo 02": "Verse 2\n\n(...)\n\nTherefore the Master\nacts without doing anything\nand teaches without saying anything.\n\nThings arise and she lets them come;\nthings disappear and she lets them go.\n\nShe has but doesn’t possess,\nacts but doesn’t expect.\nWhen her work is done, she forgets it.\nThat is why it lasts forever.",
  "Capitulo 03": "Verse 3\n\nIf you overesteem great men,\npeople become powerless.\nIf you overvalue possessions,\npeople begin to steal.\nThe Master leads\nby emptying people’s minds and\nfilling their cores, by weakening their ambition\nand toughening their resolve.\nHe helps people lose everything\nthey know, everything they desire,\nand creates confusion\nin those who think that they know.\nPractice not-doing,\nand everything will fall into place",
  "Capitulo 04": "Verse 04\n\nThe Tao is like a well:\nused but never used up.\nIt is like the eternal void:\nfilled with infinite possibilities.\n\nIt is hidden but always present.\nI don’t know who gave birth to it.\nIt is older than God.",
  "Capitulo 05": "Verse 5\n\nThe Tao doesn’t take sides;\nit gives birth to both good and evil.\nThe Master doesn’t take sides;\nshe welcomes both saints and sinners.\n\nThe Tao is like a bellows:\nit is empty yet infinitely capable.\nThe more you use it, the more it produces;\nthe more you talk of it, the less you understand.\nHold on to the center.",
  "Capitulo 06": "verse 6\n\nThe Tao is called the Great Mother:\nempty yet inexhaustible,\nit gives birth to infinite worlds.\nIt is always present within you.\nYou can use it any way you want.",
  "Capitulo 07": "Verse 7\n\n\nThe Tao is infinite, eternal.\nWhy is it eternal?\nIt was never born;\nthus it can never die.\nWhy is it infinite?\nIt has no desires for itself;\nthus it is present for all beings.\n\nThe Master stays behind;\nthat is why she is ahead.\nShe is detached from all things;\nthat is why she is one with them.\nBecause she has let go of herself,\nshe is perfectly fulfilled.\n",
  "Capitulo 08": "Verse 8\n\n\nThe supreme good is like water,\nwhich nourishes all things without trying to.\nIt is content with the low places that people disdain.\nThus it is like the Tao.\nIn dwelling, live close to the ground.\nIn thinking, keep to the simple.\nIn conflict, be fair and generous.\nIn governing, don’t try to control.\nIn work, do what you enjoy.\nIn family life, be completely present.\nWhen you are content to be simply yourself\nand don’t compare or compete,\neverybody will respect you.",
  "Capitulo 09": "Verse 09 \n\nFill your bowl to the brim\nand it will spill.\nKeep sharpening your knife\nand it will blunt.\nChase after money and security\nand your heart will never unclench.\nCare about people’s approval\nand you will be their prisoner.\nDo your work, then step back.\nThe only path to serenity.",
  "Capitulo 10": "Verse 10\n\nCan you coax your mind from its wandering\nand keep to the original oneness?\n\nCan you let your body become\nsupple as a newborn child’s?\n\nCan you cleanse your inner vision\nuntil you see nothing but the light?\n\nCan you love people and lead them\nwithout imposing your will?\n\nCan you deal with the most vital matters\nby letting events take their course?\n\nCan you step back from your own mind\nand thus understand all things?\n\nGiving birth and nourishing,\nhaving without possessing,\nacting with no expectations,\nleading and not trying to control:\nthis is the supreme virtue.",
  "Capitulo 11": "\n\n\nWe join spokes together in a wheel,\nbut it is the center hole\nthat makes the wagon move.\n\nWe shape clay into a pot,\nbut it is the emptiness inside\nthat holds whatever we want.\n\nWe hammer wood for a house,\nbut it is the inner space\nthat makes it livable.\n\nWe work with being,\nbut non-being is what we use.",
  "Capitulo 12": "Verse 12\n\nColors blind the eye.\nSounds deafen the ear.\nFlavors numb the taste.\nThoughts weaken the mind.\nDesires wither the heart.\n\nThe Master observes the world\nbut trusts his inner vision.\n\nHe allows things to come and go.\nHis heart is open as the sky.",
  "Capitulo 13": " \nVerse 13\n\n\nSuccess is as dangerous as failure.\nHope is as hollow as fear.\nWhat does it mean that success is as dangerous as failure?\nWhether you go up the ladder or down it,\nyour position is shaky.\nWhen you stand with your two feet on the ground,\nyou will always keep your balance.\nWhat does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?\nHope and fear are both phantoms\nthat arise from thinking of the self.\nWhen we don’t see the self as self,\nwhat do we have to fear?\nSee the world as your self.\nHave faith in the way things are.\nLove the world as your self;\nthen you can care for all things.",
  "Capitulo 14": "\n\n\n\nLook, and it can’t be seen.\nListen, and it can’t be heard.\nReach, and it can’t be grasped.\nAbove, it isn’t bright.\nBelow, it isn’t dark.\nSeamless, unnamable,\nit returns to the realm of nothing.\nForm that includes all forms,\nimage without an image,\nsubtle, beyond all conception.\nApproach it and there is no beginning;\nfollow it and there is no end.\nYou can’t know it, but you can be it,\nat ease in your own life.\nJust realize where you come from:\nthis is the essence of wisdom.",
  "Capitulo 15": "15th Verse\n\n\nThe ancient masters were profound and subtle.\nTheir wisdom was unfathomable.\nThere is no way to describe it.\n\nOne can only describe them vaguely by their appearance.\nWatchful, like men crossing a winter stream.\nAlert, like men aware of danger.\nSimple, as uncarved wood.\nHollow like caves.\nYielding, like ice about to melt.\nAmorphous, like muddy water.\n\nBut the muddiest water clears\nas it is stilled.\nAnd out of that stillness\nlife arises.\n\nHe who keeps the Tao does not want to be full.\nBut precisely because he is never full,\nhe can remain like a hidden sprout\nand does not rush to early ripening.",
  "Capitulo 16": "\n\n\n\nEmpty your mind of all thoughts.\nLet your heart be at peace.\nWatch the turmoil of beings,\nbut contemplate their return.\nEach separate being in the universe\nreturns to the common source.\nReturning to the source is serenity.\nIf you don’t realize the source,\nyou stumble in confusion and sorrow.\nWhen you realize where you come from,\nyou naturally become tolerant,\ndisinterested, amused,\nkindhearted as a grandmother,\ndignified as a king.\nImmersed in the wonder of the Tao,\nyou can deal with whatever life brings you,\nand when death comes, you are ready.",
  "Capitulo 17": "\nVerse 17\n\n\n\nWhen the Master governs, the people\nare hardly aware that he exists.\n\nNext best is a leader who is loved.\nNext, one who is feared.\n\nThe worst is one who is despised.\nIf you don’t trust the people,\nyou make them untrustworthy.\n\nThe Master doesn’t talk, he acts.\nWhen his work is done,\nthe people say, “Amazing\n",
  "Capitulo 18": "\nverse 18\n\n\n\nWhen the great Tao is forgotten,\ngoodness and piety appear.\n\nWhen the body’s intelligence declines,\ncleverness and knowledge step forth.\nWhen there is no peace in the family,\nfilial piety begins.\n\nWhen the country falls into chaos,\npatriotism is born.\n",
  "Capitulo 19": "\nVerse 19\n\nThrow away holiness and wisdom,\nand people will be a hundred times happier.\n\nThrow away morality and justice,\nand people will do the right thing.\n\nThrow away industry and profit,\nand there won’t be any thieves.\n\nIf these three aren’t enough,\njust stay at the center of the circle\nand let all things take their course.\n",
  "Capitulo 20": "    Verse 20\n\n\nStop thinking, and end your problems.\nWhat difference between yes and no?\nWhat difference between success and failure?\nMust you value what others value,\navoid what others avoid?\nHow ridiculous!\n\nOther people are excited,\nas though they were at a parade.\nI alone don’t care,\nI alone am expressionless,\nlike an infant before it can smile.\nOther people have what they need;\nI alone possess nothing.\n\nI alone drift about,\nlike someone without a home.\nI am like an idiot, my mind is so empty.\nOther people are bright;\nI alone am dark.\n\nOther people are sharp;\nI alone am dull.\nOther people have a purpose;\nI alone don’t know.\nI drift like a wave on the ocean,\nI blow as aimless as the wind.\nI am different from ordinary people.\nI drink from the Great Mother’s breasts.",
  "Capitulo 21": "    Verse 21\n\nThe Master keeps her mind\nalways at one with the Tao;\nthat is what gives her her radiance.\n\nThe Tao is ungraspable.\nHow can her mind be at one with it?\nBecause she doesn’t cling to ideas.\nThe Tao is dark and unfathomable.\nHow can it make her radiant?\nBecause she lets it.\n\nSince before time and space were,\nthe Tao is.\nIt is beyond is and is not.\nHow do I know this is true?\nI look inside myself and see.",
  "Capitulo 22": "\n\n22 th  Verse\n\nThe flexible are preserved unbroken.\nThe bent become straight.\nThe empty are filled.\nThe exhausted become renewed.\nThe poor are enriched.\nThe rich are confounded.\n\nTherefore the sage embraces the one.\nBecause he doesn’t display himself,\npeople can see his light.\nBecause he has nothing to prove\npeople can trust his words.\nBecause he doesn’t know who he is,\npeople recognize themselves in him.\nBecause he has no goal in mind,\neverything he does succeeds.\n\nThe old saying that the flexible are preserved unbroken is surely right!\n\nIf you have truly attained wholeness,\neverything will flock to you.",
  "Capitulo 23": "Verse 23\n\nExpress yourself completely,\nthen keep quiet.\n\nBe like the forces of nature:\nwhen it blows, there is only wind;\nwhen it rains, there is only rain;\nwhen the clouds pass, the sun shines through.\n\nIf you open yourself to the Tao,\nyou are at one with the Tao\nand you can embody it completely.\nIf you open yourself to insight,\nyou are at one with insight\nand you can use it completely.\n\nIf you open yourself to loss,\nyou are at one with loss\nand you can accept it completely.\nOpen yourself to the Tao,\nthen trust your natural responses;\nand everything will fall into place.",
  "Capitulo 24": "\n\nVerse 24\n\n\nHe who stands on tiptoe\ndoesn’t stand firm.\nHe who rushes ahead\ndoesn’t go far.\n\nHe who tries to shine\ndims his own light.\nHe who defines himself\ncan’t know who he really is.\n\nHe who has power over others\ncan’t empower himself.\n\nHe who clings to his work\nwill create nothing that endures.\nIf you want to accord with the Tao,\njust do your job, then let go.",
  "Capitulo 25": "Verse 25\n\nThere was something formless and perfect\nbefore the universe was born.\n\nIt is serene. Empty.\nSolitary. Unchanging.\nInfinite. Eternally present.\nIt is the mother of the universe.\n\nFor lack of a better name,\nI call it the Tao.\n\nIt flows through all things,\ninside and outside, and returns\nto the origin of all things.\n\nThe Tao is great.\nThe universe is great.\nEarth is great.\nMan is great.\n\nThese are the four great powers.\nMan follows the earth.\nEarth follows the universe.\nThe universe follows the Tao.\nThe Tao follows only itself.",
