    const capitulos = {
  "A Clear Spirit": "\n\nThe spirit is where knowledge gathers; when the spirit is clear,\nknowledge is illumined. Knowledge is the seat of the heart; when\nknowledge is objective, the heart is even.\n\nThe reason people use limpid water for a mirror, not a moving stream, is that it is clear and still. Thus when the spirit is clear and the attention is even, it is then possible to discern people’s true conditions.\n\nTherefore use of this inevitably depends on not exploiting. When a\nmirror is clear, dust does not dirty it; when the spirit is clear, habitual cravings do not delude it.\n\nSo if the mind goes anywhere, the spirit is there in a state of arousal; if you return it to emptiness, that will extinguish compulsive activity, so it can be at rest.\n\n This is the freedom of sages. This is why those who govern the world must realize the true condition of essence and life before they can do so.",
  "Already Dead": "    \n    \n“If by setting one’s heart right every morning and evening,\n one is able to live as though his body were already dead, \n he gains freedom in the Way.”―Yamamoto Tsunetomo,",
  "Be Clear": "\n\nDon’t be surprised, don’t be startled; all things will arrange themselves.\n\nDon’t cause a disturbance, don’t exert pressure; all things will clarify\nthemselves.\n    - HUAI-NAN-TZU-\n",
  "Deviations": "\n\nThose whom we call sages rest peacefully in their places according to the time and enjoy their work as appropriate to the age.\n\nSadness and happiness are deviations of virtue; likes and dislikes are a\nburden to the mind; joy and anger are excesses on the Way.\n\nWhen the body is worked without rest, it collapses; when vitality is used without rest, it is exhausted. Therefore sages, heedful of this, do not dare to be excessive.\n\n They do not start anything for profit or initiate anything that would cause harm. ",
  "Fasting of the Heart": "\n\nFasting of the Heart\n\nThe sage does not seek to hear with the ears.\nNor does he listen with the mind.\n\nTrue hearing is of the spirit.\nIt is hearing with the whole being.\n\nTo hear with the ears is limited.\nTo hear with the mind is divided.\nBut the spirit hears without form,\nwithout attachment to meaning, without choice.\n\nWhen the senses are emptied,\nthe whole being becomes listening.\nAnd what is present\nreveals itself without effort.\n\nNothing is caught by the ears,\nnor grasped by the mind.\nBut all is perceived\nwhen the heart fasts.\n\nFasting of the heart is emptying.\nIt is release from noise,\nfrom thoughts,\nfrom self.\n\nIn the emptiness of all faculties,\nunity arises.\nIn unity,\nfreedom.",
  "Immovable Mind": "\n\nThe mind that stops or is moved by something and sent into confusion - this is the affliction of the abiding place, and this is the common man. To be called, to respond without interval, is the wisdom of all Buddhas.",
  "Inaction": "\n\n\n“You have only to rest in inaction and things \nwill transform themselves. Smash your form and body, \nspit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a thing\n among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep and boundless.”\n                ―Zhuangzi",
  "Lao Tzu Said": "\n\n\n\n“Because one believes in oneself, one doesn't try to convince others. Because one is content with oneself, one doesn't need others' approval. Because one accepts oneself, the whole world accepts him or her.”―Lao Tzu\n\n\n“Act without expectation.”―Lao Tzu \n\n\n“A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving.”―Lao Tzu",
  "Moderate man": "\n\n\n\nThe mark of a moderate man is freedom from his own ideas. \nTolerant like the sky, all-pervading like sunlight, firm like a mountain, \nsupple like a tree in the wind, he has no destination in view and makes use\nof anything life happens to bring his way.",
  "Naturalness": "    Naturalness\n\n\nThose who let calculation run their lives work hard without accomplishment. \n\nWhen likes and dislikes proliferate, troubles follow along.\n\nThose who let their eyes and ears look at and listen to whatever they may,\ntire their minds thereby and so lack clarity. \n\nThose who use intellectual rumination to exercise control, pain their minds thereby and accomplish nothing.\n\nIf you follow the logic of true reason and go by the naturalness of heaven and earth, then the whole universe is no match for you.\n\nWen-Tzu",
  "Non Action": "\n\n\nThe non-action of the wise man is not inaction.\nIt is not studied. It is not shaken by anything.\nThe sage is quiet because he is not moved,\nNot because he wills to be quiet.\nStill water is like glass.\nYou can look in it and see the bristles on your chin.\nIt is a perfect level;\nA carpenter could use it.\nIf water is so clear, so level,\nHow much more the spirit of man?\nThe heart of the wise man is tranquil.\nIt is the mirror of heaven and earth\nThe glass of everything.\n\nEmptiness, stillness, tranquillity, tastelessness,\nSilence, non-action: this is the level of heaven and earth.\nThis is perfect Tao. Wise men find here\nTheir resting place.\nResting, they are empty.\n\nFrom emptiness comes the unconditioned.\nFrom this, the conditioned, the individual things.\nSo from the sage’s emptiness, stillness arises:\nFrom stillness, action. From action, attainment.\nFrom their stillness comes their non-action, which is also action\nAnd is, therefore, their attainment.\nFor stillness is joy. Joy is free from care\nFruitful in long years.\n\nJoy does all things without concern:\nFor emptiness, stillness, tranquillity, tastelessness,\nSilence, and non-action\nAre the root of all things.\n",
  "Single Minded": "\n\n\n\n“All that matters is having single-minded purpose ,\nin the here and now. Life is an ongoing succession \nof ‘one will’ at a time, each and every moment.\nA man who realizes this truth need not hurry to do, \nor seek, anything else anymore. Just live in the present\nwith single-minded purpose. \n \nPeople forget this important truth, and keep seeking other \nthings to accomplish. Having the resolve to stay the course \ncomes only with years of dedicated training. \n \nIf you are enlightened to this mind-set just once, \nit will always be with you, even if you are not conscious\nof it everyday. \n \nYour life will become simple and clear if \nyou are unwavering in purpose, knowing that ‘now’ is the time to act. \nLoyalty is a virtue born of this state of mind.”\n    \n    ―Yamamoto Tsunetomo\n",
  "True Men": "The true men of old\nKnew no lust for life,\nNo dread of death.\n\nTheir entrance was without gladness,\nTheir exit, yonder,\nWithout resistance.\n\nEasy come, easy go.\nThey did not forget where from,\nNor ask where to,\nNor drive grimly forward\nFighting their way through life.\n\nThey took life as it came, gladly;\nTook death as it came, without care;\n\nThey had no mind to fight Tao.\nThey did not try, by their own contriving,\nTo help Tao along.\n\nThese are the ones we call true men.\nMinds free, thoughts gone\nBrows clear, faces serene.\n\nWere they cool? Only cool as autumn.\nWere they hot? No hotter than spring.\nAll that came out of them\nCame quiet, like the four seasons.",
  "Unattached": "\n\n\n“If a warrior is not unattached to life and death, he will be of no use whatsoever. \nThe saying that “All abilities come from one mind” sounds as though it has to do with sentient matters, but it is in fact a matter of being unattached to life and death. \nWith such non-attachment one can accomplish any feat.”―Yamamoto Tsunetomo",
  "Verse 38 Tao": "\n\n\n\nThe Master doesn’t try to be powerful;\nthus he is truly powerful.\nThe ordinary man keeps reaching for power;\nthus he never has enough.",
  "When Stop": "\n\n\n\n\nIf you persist in trying to attain what is never attained \n(It is Tao's gift), if you persist in making effort to obtain\nwhat effort cannot get, if you persist in reasoning about what \ncannot be understood, you will be destroyed by the very thing you seek. \nTo know when to stop, to know when you can get no further by your own action, this is the right beginning!"
